## Introduction & Motivation
Social media has proven to be one of the more popular discoveries to have come out of the internet revolution in the 21st century. It has helped connect people better and in doing so has enabled them to expand their network of friends, connections and colleagues beyond their geographical location. By nature of human psychology, homophily forms a major part of how and who we choose to connect with, even on the internet. After all, it’s far from a crime to get into social groups that align with our interests and world-view.  However one of possibly many unintended consequences of homophily on the internet is the role it has played in polarizing politics, especially in the United States.  And that forms a part of our motivation behind our choice of research topic. 

With political homophily, the landscape has become increasingly more divided and at times counterintuitive to the democratic ideals the country upholds. There is a growing feeling that we're all living in a bubble informed by our own opinions and world-view, owing to the magic of algorithms used by social media engines. That tunnel vision sets a dangerous precedent for political discourse in the country by making it more polarized than ever. We’d hence like to study the role political inclination tends to play on the sides we take on the country’s major political decisions. In doing so, we’d like to be able to bring to light the dangers of being over-reliant on your network of information and the need to verify, research and inform facts.

Homophily is one’s tendency to connect with people that subscribe to their world-view and core beliefs rather than those who test it. It was a term coined by sociologists in the 1950s to explain this basic human behaviour which, even in moderation, was sometimes seen as an impediment to educated discourse and dialogue, especially in the world of politics. Shared ethnicities, nationality, political inclinations or sports teams are all topics that could bring groups of people together.

Therefore the goal of our project was to try and find a common theme, especially during election years, that can help us understand political homophily better. We have explored tweets from the 2012 and 2016 election to get a list of topics that helped provide an idea of what was being spoken about during those years and compare the same with the tweets collected so far from 2020. 

## Research Question
During the 2012, 2016, and 2020 United States presidential election years, what are the top topics discussed?

## Previous Work
Our work on understanding political homophily was influenced by a research carried out on a collection of tweets from 2016 during the American Presidential election. It tries to classify users into six pre-defined political classes based on their tweets.
